a. What security mechanisms are in place to make sure the right people can pull the data?
    A security mechanism that is in place is the API key. This ensures that only people with the key are able to access the data.
    Another mechanism is limiting the rate that you can pull from the API to ensure that users are not abusing it. 
    There are also security tokens that enforce data authorization. 
b.  What kind of errors did you encounter when you tested this? How did you handle it? Was is coding errors? What about errors in how users may use the program?
    There were some coding errors where my syntax was incorrect and I handled this through looking up the correct way.
    There are also many errors that can occur due to user input, like putting in a stock that does not exist, or putting in the incorrect URL.
    There errors were handled through error checking to ensure that users are not able to break the code.
c. If you didn't know how to code something, what resources did you use? 
    I used the internet if I did not know how to code something. For example, when writing to a csv or json, 
    I looked up the API documentation for them and was able to learn from there.
