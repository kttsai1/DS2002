Based on the data, as the minutes go by, the pi number and factor continue to change. It can be difficult to determine the exact reasoning behind the generation for the numbers of pi without more details about the API, but the pattern that exists is that as the time approaches the 59-minute mark, the numbers of pi become more exact to the actual digits of pi. This can be further supported based on when the minutes are at the 0 mark, pi is the most far off, with 4 being what the API returns. As for the factor, there is a clear pattern where the factor is the cubed of whatever minute it is currently on. For example, the factor starts as 1 when we are at minute 0 and continues to increase every minute until it reaches the largest number of 205379, which is 59^3. The logic behind these changes could be that the API is using some calculations to approximate pi, and as time progresses, the calculations are getting more refined, leading to a more accurate value of pi, and it uses the minute to calculate what the factor will be.
